# Custom timer app

This app aims to combine stopwatch, timer and alarm in one app.
To build, you need to clone [the SDK](https://github.com/dakhnod/Fossil-HR-Timer) and possibly adjust the Makefile, or just flash the .wapp from one of the [releases](https://github.com/dakhnod/Fossil-HR-Timer/releases).

### Stopwatch mode
When you open the app, it is in stop watch mode.
Press the middle button to start the stopwatch.
Pressing the upper button while it's running resets it.
Pressing the lower button while it's running creates lap timer.

### Timer mode
After opening the app and it's in stopwatch mode, instead of starting the stopwatch, press the lower button.
This will allow you to select your timer time by using the upper/lower button.
The lower button always moves the hands to the next 5-minute-mark.
The upper button subtracts one minute from the currently set timer time.
Long pressing the upper/lower button will make the hands move until you release the button.
Press the middle button to start the timer.

While the timer is running, you can add/subtract a minute with the lower/upper button.
Pressing the middle button stops the timer and brings you back to the time selection.

### Alarm mode
This is just an alternative way of setting a timer time.
After opening the app and it's in stopwatch mode, instead of starting the stopwatch, press the upper button.
This will set the hands to the current time.
(Long) pressing the upper/lower button move the hands to the time you want the timer to stop.
SO, you don't set the timer directly, but set the absolute time when it needs to stop, like with a regular alarm clock.
As an example: It's 6:05 currently, and you set the hands to point at 7:00.
After starting, the timer will start to count down 0:55, e.g. 55 minutes, since thats the time delta to your set time.
After pressing the middle button, the watch will calculate the time to your set time and switch to timer mode.
